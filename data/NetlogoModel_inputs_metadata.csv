resolution,Resolution of raster files
completedIterAndTileNumFileName,Name for csv file containing the numbers of processed tiles and completed iterations
projectionFile,Path to a .prj file
hPopM,Slope of the curve fitting the movement probabilities for movement in different human population categories (see manuscript and appendix for more details)
hPopC,Intercept of the curve fitting the movement probabilities for movement in different human population categories (see manuscript and appendix for more details)
