Output File,Description
modelComplete.txt,A file to indicate if the model is complete (all iterations and runs after iterations are complete). Delete to run from the beginning
movementCoordinates.csv,CSV containing coordinates of each new step of individuals. 
transientStatus.csv,"CSV containing status of each transient (dead/settled, number of steps moved, dispersal distance). "
agentLocations.csv,CSV containing locations of agents that have reached the boundary of a tile. These agents will be loaded in the iterative runs after N iterations. Agents are loaded only if their coordinates are within the extent of the tile
residentStatus.csv,"CSV containing status of each resident (number of steps moved, home range radius). "
CompletedIterAndTileNum.csv,CSV containing completed tile number and iteration number
completedTileNums.csv,CSV containing completed tile number and run number (for iterative runs after N iterations)
<Species>output_numCrossing_Itn<iterationNum>_Tile< tileNumber>,"Raster of a tile, with each pixel containing number of crossings in 1 iteration"
<Species>output_numIndividuals_Itn<iterationNum>_Tile< tileNumber>,"Raster of a tile, with each pixel containing number of individuals in 1 iteration"
movementCoordinates_afterN_<iterationNum>_<tileNum>.csv,CSV containing coordinates of each new step of individuals that had reached a boundary of a tile. 
transientStatus_afterN_<iterationNum>_<tileNum>.csv,"CSV containing status of each transient (dead/settled, number of steps moved, dispersal distance), for transients that had reached a boundary of a tile."
residentStatus_afterN_<iterationNum>_<tileNum>.csv,"CSV containing status of each resident (number of steps moved, home range radius) for residents that had reached a boundary of a tile"
